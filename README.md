# fasterinteractive2022

This repository is the companion repository of the paper entitled "Acoustical and Behavioral Heuristics for Fast Interactive Sound Design".

There are four main steps :
 - install required libraries : with pip, run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" 
 - compute features (already available, warning computationally expensive) : "python compute_descriptors.py"
 - ipynb file level_selection_paper_version.ipynb runs and display numerical simulations
 - ipynb file stat_hyp_test.ipynb performs statistical testing measuring the relevance of modality selection
